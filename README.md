### MVP/PostMVP

This application will provide an input field upon loading, the user will enter their City and the output will randomize a trailhead and brewery near selected location.  This app will be geared towards phone use but will be just as clean and responsive on a desktop.  Beautiful imagery will pull the look together.

#### MVP 

- Implement random brewery and trail selections
- Generates information within parameters specified by user input
- Responds to both cell phone and desktop screens 

#### PostMVP  

- Animation 
- Incorporate facts about brewery/hiking
- Add unique UI and event listeners
